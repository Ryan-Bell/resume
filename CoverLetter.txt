Dear Hiring Manager,

Please accept my resume in consideration for the Aviture Software Developer
position. I am preparing to graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology in
the Spring and I am confident my experience, skills, and interests in software
development have prepared me to be an effective member of your team. 

The experience I gained through my internships at GE Aviation, the MITRE
Corporation, and BrickSimple LLC provided applicable skills not only around
common areas such as web development, but also more unique areas such as virtual
and augmented reality, game development, and 3D modeling. For instance, while
working at BrickSimple I helped make a CPR simulation system using the HTC vive
for a University of Pennsylvannia research project.

The potential to develop quality real-world solutions to challenging projects
with this role really appeals to me. As a Nebraska native I understand
Midwestern work ethic and look forward to the opportunity to work on software
not only at the proof-of-concept level, but also as it is used by the customer. 

Please feel free to contact me at 267.893.0688 or 42rbell@gmail.com. I look
forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and strengths can best serve
Aviture's software development team.

Thank you for your consideration,

Ryan Bell
